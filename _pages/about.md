I am a Research Assistant at the [Center for Computational & Data Sciences (CCDS)](https://ccds.ai), Independent University, Bangladesh. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/dept/cse), [Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Khulna](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/), with a CGPA of 3.73/4.00. I have hands-on experience in both academic research and teaching, gained through roles as a Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant/Lecturer across various institutions.

My research is supervised by [Prof. Dr. Amin Ahsan Ali](http://iub.ac.bd/academics/departments/cse/faculty-and-staff/aminali) and [Prof. Dr. AKM Mahbubur Rahman](http://iub.ac.bd/academics/departments/cse/faculty-and-staff/akmmrahman) from CCDS. Currently, my researches and projects focus on Multi-modal learning (LLM based foundation models), Trustworthy ML, Federated Learning and Continual Learning/ Adaptive Learning System. I am fortunate to collaborate with and receive mentorship from [Md Mofijul Islam](https://mmiakashs.github.io/), [Aman Chadha](https://www.aman.info/), [Sajib Mistri](https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/sajib-mistry-d41c64f3/), [Ankur Sarker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankur-sarker/) (All of them are collaborators of CCDS).

I am actively looking for **Fully-funded Graduate (Ph.D / Masters) / Visiting Student Researcher positions** in good CS research labs around the globe.
