My name is Md. Akil Raihan Iftee. I am working as a Junior Research Scientist at the [Center for Computational & Data Sciences (CCDS)](https://ccds.ai), Independent University, Bangladesh.
My research is supervised by [Prof. Dr. Amin Ahsan Ali](http://iub.ac.bd/academics/departments/cse/faculty-and-staff/aminali) and [Prof. Dr. AKM Mahbubur Rahman](http://iub.ac.bd/academics/departments/cse/faculty-and-staff/akmmrahman) from CCDS. Currently, my researches and projects focus on multi-modal learning (LLM based foundation models), Privacy Preserving Machine Learning/Trustworthy ML, Federated Learning, Cyber-Physical Distributed Systems and Continual Learning/ Adaptive Learning System. I am fortunate to collaborate with and receive mentorship from [Md Mofijul Islam](https://mmiakashs.github.io/), [Aman Chadha](https://www.aman.info/), [Sajib Mistri](https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/sajib-mistry-d41c64f3/), [Ankur Sarker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankur-sarker/).

Previously, my undergraduate research, supervised by [Sunanda Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1OPbHxwAAAAJ&hl=en) at KUET, focused on 3D cerebrovascular segmentation using semi-supervised methods. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/dept/cse), [Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Khulna](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/), with a CGPA of 3.73.
