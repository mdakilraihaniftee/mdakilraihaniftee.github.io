      <strong>FedBalanceTTA: Federated Learning with Balanced Test-Time Adaptation</strong> presents a novel solution to adapt models during inference in federated settings‚Äîespecially when encountering <em>class imbalance</em> and <em>domain shift</em> in unlabeled test data streams. The framework supports privacy-preserving client-side adaptation without access to ground-truth labels.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Balanced Batch Normalization (BBN):</strong> Computes class-wise normalization statistics from pseudo-labels to mitigate bias toward dominant classes.</li>
      <li><strong>Unsupervised Test-Time Adaptation:</strong> Entropy minimization and confident pseudo-labeling optimize the model during inference.</li>
      <li><strong>Class-Aware Server Aggregation:</strong> Clients are weighted by class distribution skew to preserve minority-class performance during global update.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Aggregation:</strong> Client updates are privately shared using secure protocols, ensuring privacy of class distributions and raw data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Extensive experiments on <strong>CIFAR-10-C</strong> and <strong>CIFAR-100-C</strong> benchmarks under multiple corruption and imbalance settings demonstrate that FedBBN outperforms state-of-the-art federated and TTA baselines (e.g., TENT, CoTTA, RoTTA).

      The framework follows a three-stage process:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Client-Side Adaptation:</strong> Pseudo-labels are generated using the current model; BBN layers normalize features with per-class statistics.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Aggregation:</strong> Clients encrypt model updates and send them to the server without exposing sensitive distribution or raw data.</li>
      <li><strong>Class-Aware Global Aggregation:</strong> Server aggregates updates using a class-balance-aware weighting to produce a robust, fair global model.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

<div class="caption text-center">
  Each client adapts in isolation, and model updates are securely aggregated for bias-free global refinement.
