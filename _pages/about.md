My name is Md. Akil Raihan Iftee. I am working as a Junior Research Scientist at the [Center for Computational & Data Sciences (CCDS)](https://ccds.ai), Independent University, Bangladesh. 

My research is supervised by [Prof. Dr. Amin Ahsan Ali](http://iub.ac.bd/academics/departments/cse/faculty-and-staff/aminali) and [Prof. Dr. AKM Mahbubur Rahman](http://iub.ac.bd/academics/departments/cse/faculty-and-staff/akmmrahman).. Currently, my researches and projects focus on multi-modal learning, foundation models, test-time domain adaptation, federated learning, and human activity recognition. I am fortunate to collaborate with and receive mentorship from [Md Mofijul Islam](https://mmiakashs.github.io/), [Aman Chadha](https://www.aman.info/)

Previously, my undergraduate research, supervised by [Sunanda Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1OPbHxwAAAAJ&hl=en) at KUET, focused on 3D cerebrovascular segmentation using semi-supervised methods. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/dept/cse), [Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Khulna](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/), with a CGPA of 3.73.
